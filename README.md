# Testing-Traders
This repository contains a project where I wrote my first Unit and Integration tests. I also learned about edge case testing.

# How to setup

Install the node modules using npm;
Set test environment by typing "npm run setTestEnv"
Start tests by typing "npm run test"
Start the backend server by typing "npm start";
